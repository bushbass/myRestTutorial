# myRestTutorial

I'm building a REST API and then building a front end for CRUD operations. I am doing this as live coding on my youtube channel. Disclaimer: it's not fast paced to watch as I'm really approaching these streaming/coding sessions like 'rubber duck debugging' where I'm just doing my project and talking out loud about it to my camera.
